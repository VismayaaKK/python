object oriented programming
in this method programm is return by using class and object
class:template for creating objects.
methods:function inside a class
in object oriented programming data is stored in different location.if the variable is same
but in procedural data is stored in same location
id()is used to find the location
constructor:method that automatically call when class is called

pillers of object oriented programming:

1.abstraction:it is the process of hiding the details of an application from the outer world
2.encapsulation:the building of data ,along with the methods that operate on the data into a single unit
3.inheritence:a mechanim that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
4.polymorphism:its a feature of object oriented programming language that allows a specific routine to use of variables of different types at different times
